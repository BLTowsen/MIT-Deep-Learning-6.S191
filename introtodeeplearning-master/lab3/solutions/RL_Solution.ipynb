It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n","\n","In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n","\n","![alt text](https://www.kdnuggets.com/images/reinforcement-learning-fig1-700.jpg)\n","\n","While the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to teach agents to act in the real, physical world, games provide a convenient proving ground for developing RL algorithms and agents. Games have some properties that make them particularly well suited for RL: \n","\n","1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n","2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters; \n","3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping.

This is a similar concept to discounting money in the case of interest. ecall from lecture, we use reward discount to give more preference at getting rewards now rather than later in the future. The idea of discounting rewards is similar to discounting money in the case of interest.\n","\n","To compute the expected cumulative reward, known as the **return**, at a given timestep in a learning episode, we sum the discounted rewards expected at that time step $t$, within a learning episode, and projecting into the future.
